              Having a busy lifestyle of that of a working mum provided me many excuses to not put my health and mental wellbeing high (or even on) my priority list.
              It was far easier to put the needs of the children, work, husband, family and friends before myself.
              So, when I first met Kim his first words to me were ‘Fantastic and Improving’, I was like wow this guy is nuts,
              how can we be fantastic and still be improving isn’t fantastic what we are all aiming for?
              This was my “open door opportunity” and four years on I now enjoy the challenge of how far I can push my mind &amp; body.
              </br>
              The outdoor group training with Kim, Deb (our trainers) and the team has been the perfect support I needed to help me achieve my mental wellbeing,
              health and now fitness goals.
              All of the people in the group sessions lift and push each other to achieve more than what they believe they can, and the group support is amazing.
              </br>
              Not once have I felt bad about myself or my body in this place, there is nothing but encouragement, support and fun.
              Then there’s the trainers.
              They are always providing excellent support, encouragement, education and laughter and the flexible training options and outdoor locations were 
              perfect for my needs.

              "When I started training with Kim and his team at Krazdfit, I hadn't exercised in four years".
              <br/>
              I had lower back pain and could barely walk when I got out of bed in the morning.
              <br/>My goal was to exercise 3 times a week and on Kim's advice
              I chose a combination of strength training and cardio sessions.
              Nine months later, two days after my 40th birthday, I completed my first ever half marathon and ran all the way.
              <br/>
              When I felt like stopping I could hear Deb saying to me “Keep going, your legs won't fall off. If they do you can stop!”.
              <br/>
              I loved every minute of it and finished in 2 hours and 21 minutes, 9 minutes faster than planned!
              <br/>
              12 months after I started training with Krazdfit, I had no more back pain and my bone density scans showed a 3.2% increase in my lumbar spine and 1.3% in my hip.
              I've loved training with Kim and all the people I've met at Krazdfit who have made me feel comfortable exercising and challenging myself.
              <br/><br/>
              I've tried boot camp, boxing, run the hills and lakes of Sunbury and tried cross country running and although I'm yet to achieve a ‘proper’ burpee
              I’m sure it’s not too far away. Most important of all, we have fun, the sessions are a great laugh and I highly recommend you to join in.

              Fourteen years ago I came to the conclusion that if I kept up my current lifestyle of working long hours, eating all the wrong things and not exercising that I would be flat out seeing my Daughter start High school let alone see how she would go as an adult.</p><p>The only letterbox leaflets I used to read were the ones from fast food outlets, except for one day when I read one from personal trainer Kim Aldred.</p><p>He offered a new avenue of fitness as I had grown tired of visiting gyms where people tended to work out for 5 minutes, then stare at themselves for half an hour afterwards in the mirrors provided.</p><p>Fourteen years later I have completed events that I thought had passed me by and were now beyond me. Run for the Kids, Marysville half marathons, 50 km Docklands to Donvale just to name a few. I even did an event I hadn’t done in over 25 years-The City to Surf in Sydney.</p><p>My favourite though has been the Winter Warrior at Lake Mountain. Less than 100 competitors braved the elements-with Kim and I being two of them. Three and a half hours in snow doing an obstacle course was just awesome!</p><p>I’m still hopeful of being picked up in the AFL draft, after 38 straight years of being overlooked, I feel this year may be it!            </div>

              Kim has been my outdoor trainer for 13 years, since I was 43.He’s experienced and always positive and encouraging. He makes training fun, but pushes you to get the best out of yourself.</p><p>Outdoor small group training is ideal for me.&nbsp;It provides flexibility with training programs and encourages a natural social interaction between people in the group.&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it more enjoyable than gyms, other indoor exercise and individual training, so I keep coming back and have met some wonderful and inspiring people along the way.</p><p>The structure of scheduled sessions gives me a routine and helps me stay on track. Kim will help you set and achieve your health goals. He is always checking on my progress, offering assistance and encouragement with dieting and health. Kim customizes programs to accommodate his client’s individual circumstances, such as injuries, fitness level and capabilities. And he provides all the equipment required for your training.</p><p>Overall it’s damn good value and great for your health and wellbeing.</p><p>I am looking forward to another 13 years.

Take your pick and I will back up anything you choose</p><p>Enjoyment about training – two items</p><ol><li>No matter how cold, windy, wet or hot weather, the Welcome Board outside the oval, always gets set up before everyone shows up for training. For over 12 years, the fitness training team led by Kim have never failed that promise and commitment to be prepared to offer their support. That commitment and discipline played a good part for my great start and ongoing success.</li><li>The moment I approach the park or oval, while most of Sunbury people are still in bed, you witness that positive atmosphere of individual members getting out of their cars with towels, training equipment, etc. to be welcomed by their special nicknames and hugged by their dedicated fitness instructors as soon they walk towards the Famous Red van or outdoor training set up. Personally this positive atmosphere brings me energy and always helped to pursue the challenges mixed with unexpected training program. Every session offered new routine.

              Through Kim’s guidance as my personal trainer he has shown me his appreciation to myself and other people’s feelings, and is quick to detect any slight change, signals or influences that present themselves in any given situation.</p><p>Kim is a lively enthusiastic and engaging personal trainer who has the innate ability to read these signals from clients as well as to understand their own personal strengths and weaknesses.</p><p>In the 4 years I’ve been training under Kim I’ve created a mutual trust and a feeling of friendliness among the other members. This is important to me because of the countless hours I trained by myself in a gym. It’s the tremendous sense of camaraderie you experience when you train with all the members at KAZDFIT.</p><p>Well done guys and thank you.</p><p>I honestly recommend Kim as your personal trainer. One highly skilled individual who thoroughly understands the human anatomy and is able to help you accomplish your goals with passion. Here’s to health and longevity.
