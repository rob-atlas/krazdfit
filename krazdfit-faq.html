            <h2>Q. Will exercise help with weight loss & how?</h2>
            <p>
              Yes it can.<br>
              Generally exercise will represent around 20-30% of your weight loss potential. Small in comparison to a healthy & caloric structured diet (see a health professional for that specifically)
              We know that exercise helps your mind set for a healthy overall outlook.
            </p>
            <h2>Q. How often should I lift weights & what are some benefits?</h2>
            <p>
              Generally a full body workout twice weekly with 2-3 days rest.<br>
              Muscle growth occurs in that time with rest.<br>
              At Krazdfit we know when you are working out & we have Body Burn sessions for you Tuesday, Thursday & Saturday for that reason.<br>
              You can lift lighter weights more regularly & we do in HIIT for more cardio based exercise for toned/leaner muscle.<br>
              Helps you fight Osteo disease.<br>
              Strengthens & tones muscles.<br>
              Helps in prevention of hypertension (elevated blood pressure).<br>
            </p>
            <h2>Q. What is the best way to lose fat?</h2>
            <p> 
              Everyone will respond differently to a training program. However, there are some principles us fitness professionals try to apply..<br>
              weight bearing exercise (e.g. lunges, step ups, push & pull ups, plank etc & of course resistance training) use more calories per minute for fat loss than non-weight-bearing activities that do not use many muscles.<br>
              The total number of fat calories expended is greater for higher-intensity workouts.<br>
              Endurance-trained individuals rely less on carbohydrates and more on fat as a fuel source during sub-maximal exercise (Kiens 1997). Thus, the more Kardio (aerobically) trained you become, the more fat you will use during subsequent exercise sessions.<br>
            </p>
            <h2>Q. Do I need to take supplements?</h2>
            <p>
              You generally do not need dietary supplements unless you have a documented vitamin deficiency or do not eat a balanced diet..<br>
              Using supplements as an alternative to a sound diet can lead to serious deficits in the consumption of other nutrients (Benardot et al. 2001).<br>
            </p>
            <h2>Q. What is the best way to lose fat?</h2>
            <p>
              .<br>
            </p>
            <h2>How do I get rid of flabby arms & see a trimmer tummy?</h2>
            <p>
              Simplest answer is:.<br><br>
              One of the biggest exercise myths is that you can lose fat in an area of the body by strength training or exercising that specific body part. The truth is that “spot reducing” and “spot toning” do not work, because we cannot dictate from where our bodies will decide to oxidize fat, nor can we change fat into muscle.<br>
              All forms of exercise help decrease body fat percentage , thus lose fat on your arms & tummy.<br>
              Just as it will help lose fat from other areas of the body.<br>
            </p>
            <h2>Q. Why should I approach my training sessions with a plan?</h2>
            <p>
              Yes, this will help you get the most out of your workout.<br>
              <br>
              At Krazdfit, we tailor your goals to your sessions.<br>
              You have a PT with you & we increase, decrease intensity for each individual as well.<br>
              That way, you won't waste time procrastinating and you'll gain faster improvements as a result.<br>
            </p>
            <h2>Q. Do I need to vary my workout to see results?</h2>
            <p>
              To optimise real body change, you need to mix up your routine..<br>
              At Krazdfit you won't see the same session each day you come.<br>
              The body quickly adapts to exercise and if you continue to do the same workout or use the same weights, it will plateau as it stops responding to the training stimulus.<br>
              Increase frequency, intensity or the type of training as often as you can.<br>
              Your Krazdfit PT will ensure that.<br>
            </p>
            <h2>How do I help sore muscles?</h2>
            <p>
              Warm up for around 8 mins pre workout. Start with some dynamic stretching (active muscular stretching such as walking lunges or jogging with high knees).<br>
              Cool down & stretch for around 8 mins post workout.<br>
              Do static stretches focusing on the muscles you've worked. This will decrease your risk of injury, improve blood flow and circulation, increase your range of motion and improve muscle function. You can never stretch too much!.<br>
              Diet plays a vital role in the rate at which your body can recover - protein is crucial for decreasing muscle damage and soreness after a workout, fuel up properly.<br>
              Rest and plenty of sleep will also give the body time to repair.<br>
              Treat yourself to a bath with Epsom salts, which are packed with magnesium that will gently relax muscles.<br>
              6Or try foam rolling, which acts as a self-massage and prevents damage to the connective tissue between the muscles.<br>
              acts as a deep tissue massage.<br>
              will help improve mobility and flexibility.<br>
              Pre-workout will prepare your body for exercise by increasing circulation to the muscles you are preparing to train.<br>
              Post-workout is a great recovery tool, as it removes lactic acid (a waste product your body produces during exercise) from your muscles.<br>
            </p>
            <h2>What makes Krazdfit different to any other PT?</h2>
            <p>
              'It's all about you'.<br>

              That's it. We are passionate, reliable & exceptionally personable.<br>
            </p>
            <h2>How long does it usually take to feel the health benefits once I start?</h2>
            <p>
              After your 1st Training session.<br><br>
              You'll feel the love from your trainer and the team at Krazdfit.<br>
              The support and interaction from like minded local people is uplifting.<br>
            </p>
            <h2>What are the benefits of group PT?</h2>
            <p>
              'It's all about you'.<br><br>
              You have fun, the group has fun exercising at every individuals pace.<br>
              As trainers, we know you and we know how to maximise your training workout.<br>
